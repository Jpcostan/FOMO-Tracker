# FOMO-Tracker
A rustic Binance API price tracker webapp with a feaux old school Linux terminal overlay using vanilla JS/html/css. 

This "webapp" is not to be taken seriously and was made out of sheer boredom and to gain some exp with using Binance API calls.

For simplicities sake, HTML, CSS and JS are all embedded into ONE single file.
